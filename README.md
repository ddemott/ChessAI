## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ddemott/ChessAI.git
cd ChessAI
```

### 2. Build the Project
```bash
mvn clean compile
```

### 3. Create Executable JAR (Optional)
```bash
mvn clean package
```

### 4. Run the Game

**Option A: Using Maven**
```bash
java -cp target/classes com.ddemott.chessai.console.ConsoleChessGame
```

**Option B: Using the JAR**
```bash
java -jar target/chessai-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Game Start**: The game begins with White (human player) to move
2. **Making Moves**: Enter moves in algebraic notation format: `from to`
   - Example: `e2 e4` (move pawn from e2 to e4)
   - Example: `g1 f3` (move knight from g1 to f3)
3. **AI Response**: After each valid move, the AI automatically calculates and plays its response
4. **Exit Game**: Type `exit` to quit the game

## 🧠 AI Algorithm Details

The AI uses a **Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning**:

- **Minimax**: Evaluates future game positions by considering both player's optimal play
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Eliminates branches that won't affect the final decision, improving performance
- **Configurable Depth**: Adjustable search depth (default: 4 moves ahead)
- **Position Evaluation**: Multi-factor scoring system including material, king safety, and piece positioning

### AI Strength Levels
The AI depth can be adjusted when creating the `GameEngine`:
- **Depth 1-2**: Beginner level
- **Depth 3-4**: Intermediate level  
- **Depth 5+**: Advanced level (slower but stronger)

## 🧪 Testing

## 🧪 Testing

### Automated Testing
The core chess engine has been decoupled from the console interface, enabling comprehensive testing:

```bash
# Compile and run the comprehensive functionality test
javac -cp target/classes -d target/test-classes src/test/java/com/ddemott/chessai/GameEngineTest.java
java -cp "target/classes;target/test-classes" com.ddemott.chessai.GameEngineTest
```

**Current Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Initial game state validation
- ✅ Basic move execution and turn switching
- ✅ AI move generation and execution
- ✅ Invalid move rejection (empty squares, opponent pieces)
- ✅ Board state representation
- ✅ Console-free game state access

### Manual Testing
For additional verification:

1. Run the game and verify basic piece movements
2. Test check/checkmate scenarios
3. Verify AI makes reasonable moves
4. Test edge cases like piece capture and invalid moves

### API Testing Examples
```java
// Create a game engine without console dependency
GameEngine engine = new GameEngine(3);

// Test basic functionality
String currentPlayer = engine.getCurrentTurn(); // "White"
boolean moveSuccess = engine.movePiece("e2", "e4"); // true
String boardState = engine.getBoardRepresentation(); // String representation

// Access full game state for testing
State gameState = engine.getGameState();
```

### Known Test Results
All core functionality tests currently **PASS**:
- ✅ Initial state: White starts first
- ✅ Move validation: Proper acceptance/rejection of moves
- ✅ Turn management: Players alternate correctly
- ✅ AI functionality: Generates and executes valid moves
- ✅ Error handling: Graceful handling of invalid input
