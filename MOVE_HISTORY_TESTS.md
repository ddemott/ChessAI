- **Coverage**: Basic move recording, AI moves, undo/redo, PGN export
- **Status**: ✅ PASSING

### 2. `ComprehensiveMoveHistoryTest.java` (Full Test Suite)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive testing of all move history features
- **Coverage**: 46 test cases covering:
  - Initial state validation
  - Move recording accuracy
  - Algebraic notation generation
  - Undo/Redo sequence operations
  - Board state consistency
  - PGN export functionality
  - Edge cases and boundary conditions
  - Multiple undo/redo operations
  - Undo/Redo limits
- **Status**: ✅ ALL 46 TESTS PASSING

### 3. `MoveClassTest.java` (Unit Tests)
- **Purpose**: Unit testing of the Move class
- **Coverage**: 30 test cases covering:
  - Move object creation
  - Getter methods
  - Capture detection (normal captures and en passant)
  - toString() method
  - Factory method (createSimpleMove)
- **Status**: ✅ ALL 30 TESTS PASSING

### 4. `UndoRedoBoardIntegrityTest.java` (Board State Integrity)
- **Purpose**: Specific testing of board state integrity during undo/redo operations
- **Coverage**:
  - Board state restoration after captures
  - Piece position consistency
  - Turn management consistency
- **Status**: ✅ ALL TESTS PASSING

## Test Summary

### Total Test Coverage
- **Total Test Cases**: 76+ individual assertions
- **Areas Covered**:
  - ✅ Move Creation and Storage
  - ✅ Algebraic Notation Generation
  - ✅ Move History Tracking
  - ✅ Undo Functionality
  - ✅ Redo Functionality
  - ✅ Board State Consistency
  - ✅ Turn Management
  - ✅ PGN Export

### Key Features Tested

#### Move Recording
- ✅ Moves are properly recorded with all metadata
- ✅ Move numbering is accurate
- ✅ Player color tracking works correctly
- ✅ Captured pieces are recorded

#### Algebraic Notation
- ✅ Pawn moves generate correct notation (e.g., "e4")
- ✅ Piece moves include piece symbol (e.g., "Nf3")
- ✅ Capture notation includes 'x' symbol
- ✅ Pawn captures include source file

#### Undo/Redo Functionality
- ✅ Undo reverses moves correctly
- ✅ Board state is fully restored after undo
- ✅ Captured pieces are restored
- ✅ Turn management works during undo/redo
- ✅ Redo replays moves accurately
- ✅ Multiple undo/redo operations work correctly
- ✅ Boundary conditions are handled properly

#### PGN Export
- ✅ PGN headers are generated correctly
- ✅ Move sequences are properly formatted
- ✅ File saving works correctly
- ✅ Standard PGN format compliance

#### Edge Cases
- ✅ Undo when no moves exist
- ✅ Redo when no moves are undone
- ✅ Boundary limits are respected
- ✅ New moves clear redo history

## Running the Tests

### Individual Test Execution
```bash
# Compile tests
javac -cp target/classes -d target/test-classes src/test/java/com/ddemott/chessai/*.java

# Run specific tests
java -cp "target/classes;target/test-classes" com.ddemott.chessai.ComprehensiveMoveHistoryTest
java -cp "target/classes;target/test-classes" com.ddemott.chessai.MoveClassTest
java -cp "target/classes;target/test-classes" com.ddemott.chessai.UndoRedoBoardIntegrityTest
java -cp "target/classes;target/test-classes" com.ddemott.chessai.MoveHistoryTest
```

### Maven Integration
Tests can be run as part of the Maven build process:
```bash
mvn clean compile test
```

## Test Results Summary
- **Move History Test**: ✅ PASSING
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: ✅ 46/46 TESTS PASSING
- **Move Class Unit Tests**: ✅ 30/30 TESTS PASSING
